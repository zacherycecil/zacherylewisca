            <h2>Platform Support Engineer</h2>
            <h3>Guidewire Inc.</h3>
            <h4>June 2021 - Present</h4>
            <p>
                I've been at Guidewire for over two years now. I've spent a lot of time working with customers, keeping frequent communication and documenting solutions.
                I've worked in high stress scenarios, joining the escalation team during on-call shifts to perform platform-related tasks. It's important to ensure the customer makes a swift recovery during an outage.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a certification for the Guidewire InsuranceSuite product, PolicyCenter. I work with Guidewire's proprietary coding and scripting language, Gosu to suggest solutions for customers with custom PolicyCenter configurations.
                I am a KCS Publisher, I've written and published knowledge articles concerning case remediation and best practices for standard procedures.

            <p>
                At IBM Canada, I did QA and automation testing on IBM's enterprise security product, QRadar. I practiced clean coding techniques and attention to detail to replace their Java Selenium automation. The new automation used Spock testing framework and Apache Groovy language.

            <p>
                During my time at Clearview (the company was called Quick Service Software at the time), I implemented clean coding techniques to write automation tests in Java Selenium, while also writing and executing test plans for manual testing. 
                This work required out-of-the-box thinking and keen attention to detail to pick up on software errors that may have been missed by the developers.
