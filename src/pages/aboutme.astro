				<h1>My name is Zachery Lewis and I'm a Software Engineer.</h1>
				<p>I graduated from University of New Brunswick back in 2021 with a 3.6 GPA. During my years at UNB, I spent three semesters at IBM Canada and one at Clearview Restaurant Management Software, which earned me a Co-operative Education Designation on my transcript. After graduating, I started as a Technical Support Engineer at Guidewire Inc. Since then, I've transitioned to a Platform Support Engineer. </p>

					<h3>Platform Support Engineer <i>June 2021 - Present</i></h3>
					<h3>Mississauga, ON, Canada [remote]</h3>
					<p>
						I've been at Guidewire for over two years now. I've spent a lot of time working with customers, keeping frequent communication and documenting solutions.
						I've worked in high stress scenarios, joining the escalation team during on-call shifts to perform platform-related tasks. It's important to ensure the customer makes a swift recovery during an outage.
						I have a certification for the Guidewire InsuranceSuite product, PolicyCenter. I work with Guidewire's proprietary coding and scripting language, Gosu to suggest solutions for customers with custom PolicyCenter configurations.
						I am a KCS Publisher, I've written and published knowledge articles concerning case remediation and best practices for standard procedures.

						At IBM Canada, I did QA and automation testing on IBM's enterprise security product, QRadar. I practiced clean coding techniques and attention to detail to replace their Java Selenium automation. The new automation used Spock testing framework and Apache Groovy language.

					<h2>Clearview Restaurant Management Software</h2>
					<h3>QA Co-op Student <i>January 2018 - April 2018</i></h3>
					<h3>Fredericton, NB, Canada</h3>
					<p>
						During my time at Clearview (the company was called Quick Service Software at the time), I implemented clean coding techniques to write automation tests in Java Selenium, while also writing and executing test plans for manual testing. 
						This work required out-of-the-box thinking and keen attention to detail to pick up on software errors that may have been missed by the developers.
